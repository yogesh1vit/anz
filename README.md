sample app
I have created an address book maven project(Spring-boot) in time bound development .Please find attached source file and test output.


Few points to consider:

1.Left main project class AddressbookApplication for further dev scope in case using spring cloud  component and Web services.
2.Service APi layer can be created for the application(In future time) and Swagger implementation.
3.DB layer can be created(using JPA and Hibernate)
4.Dockerization can be done as a part of further deployment steps.
